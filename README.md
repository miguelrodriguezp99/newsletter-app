# Newsletter Subscription App

## Overview

This Newsletter Subscription App is a simple yet powerful web application designed to allow users to subscribe to a newsletter with just their email address. Once subscribed, users are added to a newsletter email list, which I, as the developer and newsletter curator, can access to distribute newsletters or updates directly to their inboxes. The app features a clean and intuitive user interface, complete with engaging animations and social media integration, making the subscription process both straightforward and enjoyable.
